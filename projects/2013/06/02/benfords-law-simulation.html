<p>For me, one of the biggest advantages that computer science gives me is the ability to test out peculiar mathematical
paradoxes and theorems in code and see them work in action, rather than just in a proof. One of the ways I found this useful
was when I decided to test Benford’s Law. I was inspired to do this after watching the Numberphile
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXjlR2OK1kM">video</a> on the topic. The theory seemed a bit hard to believe so I decided to see
if I could replicate its results in code.</p>

<h3 id="a-bit-of-background">A Bit of Background</h3>

<p>So what is Benford’s Law? It’s a mathematical principle that says that if you take the numbers you find in the real world, this
could mean numbers from stock prices, sports scores, report cards etc., that the probability that the leading digit will be 1 is
about 30%. Normally one might think that the probability should be 11% assuming that each number has an equal probability of being
a leading digit. To be more specific, the distribution of the probabilities looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yllv44j5hqc6aeo/benford3.jpg?dl=1" alt="Benford's Law" /></p>

<p>In essence what Benford’s Law is saying is that if you obtain a large set of numbers curated from your environment, a seemingly random
set of data, 30% of those numbers will have 1 as their leading digit.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-this-happen">Why does this happen?</h3>

<p>The reason for this is that numbers in the real world are not totally random. For exmaple lets imagine that all numbers
in the world were between 1 and 1000. Using a random number generator its easy to say that the probability of getting one
number is about the same as getting another. But let’s look at this as if this were the prices of objects. If an object costs
$100, it would require a 100% increase to have a leading digit of 2. This would mean that something in the environment must cause this
object’s price to double, an event that is relatively unlikely. But let’s assume that this happens and the object now costs
$200. In order for it to have a leading digit of 3, it would require a 50% increase. As you can see, it is easier for the price of this object to leave the leading digit of 2 and move to a leading digit of 3 than it is to move from a 1 to a 2. Here is a table to better explain this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Leading Digit Transition</th>
      <th>Percentage Change Required</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1 -&gt; 2</td>
      <td>100%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2 -&gt; 3</td>
      <td>50%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3 -&gt; 4</td>
      <td>33.33%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4 -&gt; 5</td>
      <td>25%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 -&gt; 6</td>
      <td>20%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6 -&gt; 7</td>
      <td>16.66%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7 -&gt; 8</td>
      <td>14.3%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8 -&gt; 9</td>
      <td>12.5%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9 -&gt; 1</td>
      <td>11.1%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Since the transition from 1 -&gt; 2 requires the greatest percentage increase, it makes sense that numbers in the real word tend
to stay in the range where the leading digit is 1 because it is the hardest to escape this region. In addition, since the required percentage increase decreases for every
subsequent transition, it means that it becomes increasingly easier to return back to a leading digit of one.</p>

<h3 id="the-program">The Program</h3>

<p>The program I wrote to simulate this was written in Java using good ol’ Swing graphics (function over form, my friends).
The issue I had to figure out was how to recreate “real world” numbers. While generating random numbers was easy, how could I
generate numbers that model those found around us. The solution I found for this was to generate random numbers with random
ranges. In code, it would look like this:</p>

<p><code>
Random numGen = new Random();
numGen.nextInt(numGen.nextInt(numGen.nextInt(1000000)));
</code></p>

<p>My program can simulate a standard set of random numbers as well as random numbers with random ranges. In addition, I added a
box where a user can enter a set of numbers separated by spaces and view the distribution of leading digits in the set. I tried
this out with world population data, stock prices I found on Yahoo Finance and to my surprise both data sets matched Benford’s Law.</p>

<p>All my code is on github (link is above) and the runnable jar is inside the repository for you to play around with. Have fun!</p>
